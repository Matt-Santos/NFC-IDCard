The design of this multifunctional PCB business card focused on two key objectives: seamlessly transferring contact information and serving as a personal keycard for simple authentication tasks, such as home automation. The front side displays personal details in text, along with a QR code containing [vCard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VCard) information. The reverse side features useful engineering references and formulas. Behind the QR code, an internal NFC antenna with a surface-mounted [NT3H2211](https://www.nxp.com/products/rfid-nfc/nfc-hf/connected-nfc-tags/ntag-ic-plus-2k-nfc-forum-type-2-tag-with-ic-interface:NTAG_I2C) chip enables touch functionality for access control or as an additional method for transferring contact information.

Note: Be sure to update the phone number and QR code information before reprinting.
